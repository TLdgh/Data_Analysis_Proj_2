# Data_Analysis_Proj_2

This project focuses on Bayesian inference. 

Goals:
- We do an A/B test using Bayesian inference on webpage design experiment. The result must show if the new design is "better" than the original design, given customer feedback.

- We do Bayesian regression analysis on some given data set. The data set belonged to a larger database called MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) comprising information relating to patients admitted to critical care units at a large tertiary care hospital. The goal is to estimate the distribution of the length of stay in the hospital.

Timelines:

- Project expected delivery: October 27th 2023

- Weekly meetings at Friday night on Teams

- Week 1: Data definition given in nice format for both sections of the project.

- Week 2: Complete Bayesian A/B test.

- Week 3: Establish Bayesian regression model.

- Week 4: complete model selection and format.
